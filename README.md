# hello-world
My first repository for discussions and ideas.
  I am a 21 year old in the states that wants to learn how to develop my own mods for minecraft and then expand my repertoire of coding languages from there. I enjoy videogames and want to learn how to make my own small games eventually and maybe even make a career of it if I can build up the skills.
